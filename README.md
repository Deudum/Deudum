My name is Dennis Traas and right now I'm learning to become a Front End Developer. After getting my Bachelor degree in Computer Science in 2011, I have mainly worked in the field of Cybersecurity (Identity & Access Management to be precise).
I'm now pursuing my passion by learning everything there is to learn about front-end development.

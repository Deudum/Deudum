After getting my Bachelor degree in Computer Science in 2011, I have mainly worked in the field of Cybersecurity (Identity & Access Management to be precise). I'm now pursuing my passion by learning everything there is to learn about front-end development.

## Sogeti :european_post_office:
I joined Sogeti in Oktober 2022 after having worked for a company called SecurIT for nine years. I spent most of my career working in the field of Identity and Access Management. Last year I made the bold decision to go for a career switch towards Front End Developer. Exciting times lay ahead, but I'm fully confident I'm up for the task and create value for Sogeti in this new role.

I've chosen to participate in this learning track, because I want to deeply broaden my knowledge on all aspects of Front End Development. This to ensure I'm fully prepared to take on a role as a Front End Developer at one of Sogeti's customers.
My expectation for this learning track is that I will gain valuable hands-on knowledge in the field of Front End Development.

## Skill level :technologist:
